# audio_localization_recorder
Combines a 4 mic array hat for the raspi 3 and a neo 6m gps module for doing accurate temporal-spatial audio recordings

Does recording using the Seeed Studio 4-mic array raspberry pi 3b hat, and a Neo 6M GPA module.  
Every sample of the audio data is associated with a reading from the GPS to record all the fancy GPS things.

Eventually to be used to analyze algorithms for audio source detection, classification, and localization.
